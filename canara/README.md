SiteBuilder Lite uses Jake (http://jakejs.com) for automated building; to edit the build file, simply open /Jakefile.js and go crazy. To run the build on Unix/Linux/OSX, open the Terminal, navigate to the application folder and run "./Jake" (on Windows, use the Jake.cmd executable).

To be able to run the build, you'll need to have Nodejs installed. Other dependencies can be found in /package.json.
